<span style="color:#ff0000;">Now that this year is over, I thought I might as well go over these resolutions and see how I fared. Now that a new year is starting, i am considering recycling my previous resolutions.</span>

<span style="color:#ff0000;"> All text in red is added later.</span>

First weekend in the new year and I have already read at least four blog posts on new year resolutions. It has spurred me to come up with my own new year resolutions list. I don't get it why people look down upon such lists? They bring so much more direction in life. Anyway, without treading in the treacherous path of digression, here are some resolutions (better read them as targets) for this year.

1) Read and write more
Setting a realistic expectation of 1 book and 1 blog post a month. I find it easier to write when I know no one is reading, but find it very difficult to let the internet read what I write. Will attempt to change this aspect about my writing.
The more well-read people I meet, the more I realise how little I have read. Setting the target of 12 books on goodreads.com (which by the way is a decent website if you are into reading).
After setting 12 books in my 2015 yearly challenge on goodreads, I realised that most of my friends on goodreads have set 50. A book a week is just too much, can't do.

<span style="color:#ff0000;">The writing goal was met halfway but with some low effort coding related posts. While these posts were immensely helpful, I think I should write better stuff this year. Happy about the way the reading goal happened in 2015. I ended up reading some really good books and so I am doubling this goal to 24 books this year. </span>

2) Weigh more than 65 Kilograms
There is no strong rationale behind this one but just the need to avoid the incessant advise by friends and family to eat more and stop looking so malnourished.

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Well, this is one tough goal, but to be honest I didn't really put in appropriate effort. Definitely continuing it this year. </span>

3) Work towards a cause through a fundraiser
Last year saw me taking up my first ever <a href="https://milaap.org/campaigns/bucketlist">fundraiser</a> (which also happened as a part of a bucket list). The experience was good enough to make me want to do this again. I just came across <a href="http://madcycletours.in/?page_id=77">this</a> fun cycling way of fundraising and I think I would also want to take this up. The cycling tour in february might be a stretch considering I haven't used a cycle in quite some time. Maybe another such tour some time else during the year.

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Ran a Bangalore Marathon 5K where my employer contributed (100USD roughly) for each employee who participated. Not the best and I barely had to do anything apart from runnning, so I should adopt this resolution for 2016 as well and do a better job at it this time around! </span>

4) Reduce facebook usage

Current levels are really high and mind numbing. I have been a dumb content consumer reading through almost everything on my facebook feed almost all the time. I should channel my time towards any of the aforementioned pursuits rather than entertaining myself through news on people in my friends list (and their friends list and so on. You know how the graph works, don't you?). I should be more definite here. So, erm, cut it down to a maximum of 10 minutes of mindless browsing?

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Laughing out loud on reading this stupid resolution.</span>

5) Learn Photography through clicking more

I made the grave mistake of buying a DSLR but not using it enough, last year. I generally get lost on when it is appropriate to take a DSLR with myself and end up leaving the DSLR to gather some dust. I enjoyed whenever I did click and I need to become better at clicking pictures. Internet reading suggests that the best way to learn photography is just to click more pictures. There is 10,000 hour rule for becoming better at anything and I guess I will adapt the  same to 10,000 clicks. This transforms to roughly 30 pictures everyday. Hmm, that's probably a very unrealistic target. Either way, I am going to stick to it, some good might come out of it. Will update clicking count here, every month or so.

<span style="color:#ff0000;">I must have reached 3000 clicks. Why the low number? Never found enough enthusiasm to go clicking as regularly because there were just other more seemingly important things to do everytime I was free. Another big lacking factor was probably company. I will re-set this number to 3000 for this year and this time I  willl find someone else to go clicking with.</span>

6) Finish one rosetta stone year-long course

Given my current level of ignorance I think that knowing English and Hindi is enough for this lifetime, however there is some charm in speaking a language that is exotic to most of the people around you. I am submitting to that charm (and the fancy of using Rosetta stone - the language learning software) and hence I want to finish an year long course on Russian on Rosetta Stone. The choice of language is also based on perceived 'coolness' (Do not judge the lack of depth in thoughts)

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Oh well, this was clearly motivated for the wrong reasons and hence I could never put in any effort towards this resolution. I think I won't take this up for next year. A new language for sometime else.</span>

7) Finish two Coursera courses

It's been a semester of not being enrolled for any classes (all hail Thesis) and I think the side-effects are not great. Must learn something all the time and hence 2015 should be the year I explore online courses with more seriousness. I should go on and enroll myself for my two courses right now!

<span style="color:#ff0000;">I tried it out for a couple of weeks but after a while, it just got too hectic. Although honestly, what lacked was good planning. So, yes, the reason I missed out on these courses was lack of discipline probably. Although, whenever I prioritized things to do, coursera courses lost out. So either I am not prioritizing correctly, or I am keeping way too many things on my plate. Lesson  I learnt here is that I should probably put a severity level on each resolution for 2016.</span>

I can't think of any more resolutions/targets right now. Probably these many are enough to keep my days full. Now comes the toughest part of course, sticking to them.

Whoever said that well planned is half done was quite stupid. If you plan it very well, the feeling of being half done so soon makes you complacent and you never end up finishing the task.

^An arbitrary thought that came to my mind when I was appreciating the beauty of my life if I stick to all these resolutions.

Never mind.
