An extension of the work done during summer internship, Magic Green Screen was the marquee feature for Presenter Video eXpress (PVX) 11. Over the course of almost a year it has received some rave reviews from Customers for its ease of use. As a part of a two membered team, my work was focused on the algorithms used for matting and despilling in the feature. Additionally, I also developed a visualisation sytem used in the feature to provide a feedback on the suitability of the recording environment for background separation to the user. The work done on matting and despilling has been filed in the USPTO as a patent, titled: `METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REAL-TIME MATTING USING LOCAL COLOR ESTIMATION AND PROPAGATION`.
