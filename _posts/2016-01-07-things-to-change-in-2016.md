So, I had this completely unoriginal brainwave to <a href="https://siddhantj.wordpress.com/2015/01/04/i-solemnly-resolve-to/">set some targets</a> for 2015 in the form of new year's resolutions and that exercise worked out fine, so here I am setting some resolutions/goals/targets for 2016.  This year however I will probably set a severity to each resolution item (yes, clearly, I have started working in the software industry) because often resolution items seem to be clash with each other. I still foresee that certain resolutions will suffer from starvation as I am not going to pay heed to them at all, but I don't really want to solve this problem. Those low priority resolutions are low priority for a reason.

Severity legend is as follows:

0: Definitely need to ensure this happens. Over everything else.
1:-4: Decreasing order of importance. Things to tackle after 0 level resolution.
5: Stretch resolutions. If everything else is over, can consider these.

So, here it goes:

&nbsp;

1) Design and Maintain a personal website - Severity - 0

I need some hosting space where I can :
a) Host my mail. Gmail Inbox is now overflowing
b) Deploy personal projects
c) Showcase past projects/cv etc. Basically sort of like a portfolio
d) Blog
I have been thinking about doing this for a really long time and it never happens. I am still enthusiastic about this idea and I should I just finish it off this year. If I clear the inertia this year, I will just have to maintain it in the time to come, which seems like an easier task to do.

2) Get Involved with an Open Source Project - Severity - 1
having appreciated and exploited open source projects every since I understood what they are, I think it is time I contribute in one and start giving back. I feel more confident about my skills now and hence putting this under this year's bucket list.

3)  Do not fail on commitments - Severity - 1

This year I probably missed out on a lot of commitments. I want this year to be zero failed commitment year. Which would basically mean saying No more often. I tend to accept everything and anything that comes my way and figure out a way to make it happen later. Of course, this sounds very cool but causes more problems than I imagined.
Zero failed commitments might not be possible, but I should at least log every time I miss on a commitment. Of course, I am playing it safe this year with my resolutions and adding a severity level to give me leeway for commitments I don't really need to meet (every non zero resolution)

4)  Befriend Non-engineers - Severity - 2

Someone pointed it out, but more than 90% of people I talk to in life are engineers. I can surely do with more diversity in thoughts/interests/experiences of the people I hang out with. So, this year I will go out of my way to talk to a more eclectic set of people in terms of their academic background at least.

5) 365 github contributions - Severity - 0

There no way to become better at coding than coding more. Although, I do write a lot of code at work, I want my side projects to be equally thriving and hence this resolution. This sort of links to the resolution of contributing to an open source project as well, but clearly, a more measurable resolution to have and I think i will focus on this one for 2016, there fore the severity.

and from my list last year, I have the following:

5) Read/Write more, Read/Write better - Severity - 3

Sounds like a resolution for  a hard drive, I know.
Stupid jokes aside, Last year I mostly wrote posts which explained some sort of code. While that is good, I want to get better at writing, so more of the following kinds of pieces to write:

1) Travelogues
2) Stories
3)  Wait-but-why kind of articles (basically research based articles on something I am trying to understand)

I did well on the reading side by reading 7 more books than I though I would. However, I quality of the books I read was not the best. This year, I want to read more and read tougher books. I have an untouched copy of War and Peace lying somewhere, I guess, i will make my peace with it this year.

6)  Gain Weight - Severity - 3

Last year the target was 65Kg. I reached no where close, so striving for it again this year. However, bumping it down in priority because there more important things to do this year.

7)  Four project towards community building - Severity -2

Basically, I should have an active social project every quarter.
Following count as valid projects:

1) Pro-bono projects
2) SpotFixes in the city (basically involves cleaning-up/fixing a shabby part of the town that is suffering from irritating levels of negligence from everyone else)
3) Fundraisers
Will add more if anything comes to mind

8) Click 3000 pictures - Severity -3

Need to click more pictures to become better at it. 10000 was too unrealistic a goal probably so toning it down this year. Let's see how this one goes.

hmm, this list doesn't sounds very appealing. Will add more if something strikes.
