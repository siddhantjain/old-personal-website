<p>Eidetic Memory, more commonly known as photographic memory is basically the ability to remember everything you perceive through most of your senses.  I just took a test <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/body-mind/psychology/take-the-photographic-memory-test">here</a>, and well the predictable happened - I failed. Obviously, I do not have a photographic memory, but still i like looking back in life to see what I was and how have I changed. It hurts when most of the times when I try doing that, my memory fails me. </p><p> </p><p>So this blog. An attempt to chronicle, my oh-so-ordinary life.  </p><p>May it live, more than the last one.   </p>
