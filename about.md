<p>Hello. Thanks for visiting my page.</p>

<p> I am a <strike>software developer</strike> computer scientist who enjoys building things (on a computer). I try to use computer vision and machine learning while I am doing that because they tend to make the things I build more fun. 
<p> Currently, I work at the eLearning group in Adobe, where I am building a video creation tool for making educational content. When I get bored of that, I experiment with Virtual Reality (apart from playing foosball). </p>

<p> From 2010 to 2015, I double-majored in Computer Science and Economics from <a href = "https://bits-pilani.ac.in">BITS Pilani</a>, India where I pursued my senior thesis under <a href = "http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/goel/profile">Prof. Navneet Goyal</a> on classification in scenarios with dynamic class structures. During undergraduation, I also served as the editor of <a href = "http://epc-bitspilani.com/"> The Fine Print </a>  - student newsletter of BITS.  </p>

<p> As an intern, I have worked for <a href ="www.emc.com"> EMC </a> and <a href = "www.avantifellows.org"> Avanti fellows </a> previously where I explored an intermittent interest in cloud technology and a long-standing affection for education, respectively.  </p>
